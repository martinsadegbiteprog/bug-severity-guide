# ðŸ§± Severity Levels

Hereâ€™s a simple severity scale most teams use:

1. **Critical (S1)**  
   - System crash or data loss  
   - No workaround

2. **High (S2)**  
   - Major feature broken  
   - Workaround exists but it's ugly

3. **Medium (S3)**  
   - Minor feature affected  
   - Doesn't block core functionality

4. **Low (S4)**  
   - Cosmetic issue or typo  
   - Zero functional impact

ðŸ’¬ Teams may tweak the scale, but keep it consistent across the project.
