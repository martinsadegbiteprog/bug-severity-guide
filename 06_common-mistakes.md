# ⚠️ Common Mistakes with Bug Severity

1. **Confusing severity with priority**
   - Just because the CEO asked for it doesn't mean it's S1.

2. **Inflating severity to get attention**
   - It backfires. Trust erodes fast.

3. **Being inconsistent**
   - One tester’s S2 shouldn’t be another’s S4.

4. **Ignoring impact on users**
   - Always ask: “What happens to the user because of this?”

5. **Not revisiting severity**
   - Severity can change as features evolve or bugs compound.

🧠 Rule of thumb:  
If everyone on your team understands severity the same way, you’re doing it right.
