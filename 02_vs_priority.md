# 🔍 Severity vs Priority

They are *not* the same.

| Aspect     | Severity                      | Priority                    |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Definition | Impact on the system          | Urgency to fix              |
| Owner      | QA usually defines it         | PM or team leads define it  |
| Scope      | Technical/system-level impact | Business/time-sensitive     |

💡 Example:
- A crash when clicking “Submit” = High Severity, High Priority.
- A broken footer link = Low Severity, but could be High Priority if it's for legal compliance.
