# 📝 How to Report Severity

To make severity *useful*, you have to communicate it well.

✔️ Include in your bug ticket:
- Observed vs Expected behavior
- Steps to reproduce
- Severity label (S1–S4)
- Justification: "Why is this S2?"

---

🎯 Example:

**Title**: App crashes when uploading .mov files (S1)

**Steps**:
1. Go to Upload page
2. Upload a .mov file
3. App crashes

**Why S1?**
- System crashes
- Affects 100% of users
- No workaround
