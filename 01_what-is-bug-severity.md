# ðŸ§ª What is Bug Severity?

**Bug Severity** measures the **impact** of a defect on the system â€” how badly the system breaks.

It answers the question:  
**"How much damage does this bug do?"**

Severity is *objective*. It doesnâ€™t care about timelines or business deals. It cares about the code, the user experience, and the risk.

Examples:
- A login button not working = high severity.
- A typo in a tooltip = low severity.
